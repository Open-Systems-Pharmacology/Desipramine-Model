# Desipramine-Model
Parent-metabolite PBPK model of desipramine and its metabolite 2-hydroxydesipramine including CYP2D6 DGIs. 

# Repository files
Within this repository, we distribute a PK-Sim snapshot containing simulations of all published clinical (DGI) studies used to develop the parent-metabolite model of desipramine, including the respective observed data digitized from literature reports.
